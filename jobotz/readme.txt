This the JOBotz package. It contains the JOBotz addon and game maps prepared to work with the addon.

JOBotz makes AI bots in game Joint Operation behave dynamically. Nothing is pre-scripted,
the addon figures out where to move the bots.

Currently the JOBotz addon can make the bots play AAS maps:
° The bots attack the active LFP targets
° The bots respawn at fully captured LFP targets
° The bots affect the takeover of LFP targets
° But currently the bots themselves cant take over LFP target (they can't flip the flag)

Requirements:
° Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising or Combined Arms version 1.757 standalone or Steam version
° The addon requires about 500MB of memory for its own purposes, depending on map size and complexity.
° Some of the calculation is CPU intensive, if this proves to be a problem for someone using this addon, 
i will implement further possibilities to limit CPU usage.

Installation:
° Install Java 8 from www.java.com.
° Make an empty folder of your choice. For example C:\Games\JOBotz.
° Extract the ZIP file to an empty folder of your choice. 
° Copy the files from "maps" subforder to where your Joint Operation game is installed.

Using the addon:
° Start the addon by doble-clicking the "jobotz.cmd" batch-file.
° A message will appear repeatedly: "Waiting 3 sec for JO process"
° The addon is ready to interact with the Joint Operations game.
° Start the game, you can start a LAN game or connect to Novaworld.
° You can use both dedicated serving and serve&play.
° If you intend to play alone, host a LAN game in serve&play mode.

Maps included:
° Karo Highland with 100 bots on each side (200 bots total)
